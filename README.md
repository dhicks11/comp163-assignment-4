# comp163-assignment-4# College Life Adventure Game

## Author
Daylen Hicks - COMP 163, Fall 2025

## Description
A text-based game simulating a college student's semester. Players make choices about **course load, study strategy, parties, and final exams**, which affect **GPA, study hours, social points, and stress levels**.


## Branching Concepts

- **Course Planning:** `if/elif/else` with comparison operators (`>=`, `<=`) for GPA and stress adjustments.  
- **Study Strategy:** Membership (`in`) and logical (`and`, `or`) operators to affect GPA and social points.  
- **Party Decisions:** Nested `if` statements with consequences for social points and stress.  
- **Final Exam:** Nested `if` statements, identity operators (`is`, `is not`), and multiple endings.

-
# AI helped clarify membership operator syntax for this validation
if user_choice in available_options:
    # Rest of logic developed independently
AI was used **only for clarification of Python syntax and logic** (e.g., safe usage of `is` / `is not`, nested if statements, and logical operators).  

## How to Run

```bash
python [username] assignment_4.py
